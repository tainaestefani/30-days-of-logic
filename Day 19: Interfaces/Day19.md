## Objective
Today, we're learning about Interfaces.

## Task
The `AdvancedArithmetic` interface and the method declaration for the abstract `divisorSum(n)` method are provided for you in the editor below.

Complete the implementation of `Calculator` class, which implements the `AdvancedArithmetic` interface. The implementation for the `divisorSum(n)` method must return the sum of all divisors of `n`.

## Example

- `n = 25`: The divisors of `25` are `1,5,25`. Their sum is `31`.
- `n = 20`: The divisors of `20` are `1,2,4,5,10,20` and their sum is `42`.

## Input Format

A single line with an integer, `n`.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 1000`

## Output Format

You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. The locked template code in the editor below will call your code and print the necessary output.

## Sample Input
```yaml
6
```

## Sample Output
```yaml
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
```
