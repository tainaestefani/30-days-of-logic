## Objective
Today, we are learning about an algorithmic concept called recursion.

## Function Description
Complete the factorial function in the editor below. Be sure to use recursion.

`factorial` has the following parameter:
- `int n`: an integer

### Returns
- `int`: the factorial of `n`

> **Note**: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function `factorial` or `Factorial`, you will get a score of 0.

## Input Format
A single integer, `n` (the argument to pass to `factorial`).

## Constraints
- `2 ≤ n ≤ 12`
- Your submission must contain a recursive function named `factorial`.

## Sample Input
```yaml
3
```

## Sample Output
```yaml
6
```
