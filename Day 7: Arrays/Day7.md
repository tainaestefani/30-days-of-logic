## Objective
Today, we will learn about the Array data structure.

## Task
Given an array, `A`, of `N` integers, print `A`'s elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Example
**Input:** 
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Output:**  
```
4 3 2 1
```
Each integer is separated by one space.

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer, `N` (the size of the array).  
The second line contains `N` space-separated integers that describe array `A`'s elements.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ N ≤ 1000`
- `1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10000`, where `A[i]` is the `i^-th` integer in the array.

## Output Format
Print the elements of array `A` in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

## Sample Input
```yaml
4
1 4 3 2
```

## Sample Output
```yaml
2 3 4 1
```
