## Objective
Today, we're getting started with Exceptions by learning how to parse an integer from a string and print a custom error message.

## Task
Read a string, `S`, and print its integer value; if `S` cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String.

> **Note:** You must use the String-to-Integer and exception handling constructs built into your submission language. If you attempt to use loops/conditional statements, you will get a  score.

## Input Format

A single string, `S`.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ S ≤ 6, where S is the length of string S`.
- `S is composed of either lowercase letters () or decimal digits ().`

## Output Format

Print the parsed integer value of `S`, or `Bad String` if `S` cannot be converted to an integer.

## Sample Input 0
```yaml
3
```

## Sample Output 0
```yaml
3
```

## Sample Input 1
```yaml
za
```

## Sample Output 1
```yaml
Bad String
```
