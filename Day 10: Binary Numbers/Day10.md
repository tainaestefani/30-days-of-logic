## Objective
Today, we’re working with binary numbers.

## Task
Given a base-10 integer, `n`, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in `n`'s binary representation. When working with different bases, it is common to show the base as a subscript.

### Example
`n = 125`

The binary representation of `125₁₀` is `1111101₂`. In base 10, there are 5 and 1 consecutive ones in two groups. Print the maximum, `5`.

## Input Format
A single integer, `n`.

## Constraints
- `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁶`

## Output Format
Print a single base-10 integer that denotes the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of `n`.

## Sample Input 1
```yaml
5
```

## Sample Output 1
```yaml
1
```

## Sample Input 2
```yaml
13
```

## Sample Output 2
```yaml
2
```
