## Objective
In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. Check out the **Tutorial** tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

## Task
Given an integer, `n`, perform the following conditional actions:
- If `n` is **odd**, print `Weird`.
- If `n` is **even** and in the inclusive range of **2 to 5**, print `Not Weird`.
- If `n` is **even** and in the inclusive range of **6 to 20**, print `Weird`.
- If `n` is **even** and greater than **20**, print `Not Weird`.

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not `n` is weird.

## Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer, **n**.

## Constraints
- \( 1 <= `n` <= 100 \)

## Output Format
Print `Weird` if the number is weird; otherwise, print `Not Weird`.
